# Sen2Like
Generation of Analysis Ready Dataset - Sentinel-2 Mission category.
   
## About

The __Sen2Like__, [1] demonstration processor has been developed by ESA in the framework of the EU Copernicus programme (https://www.copernicus.eu/).

The main goal of __Sen2Like__ is to generate Sentinel-2 like harmonised/fused surface reflectances with higher periodicity by integrating additional compatible optical mission sensors.

It is a contribution to on going worldwide initiatives (*NASA-HLS, Force, CESBIO [2],[3]) undertook to facilitate higher level processing starting from harmonized data. 

The __Sen2Like__ framework is a scientific and open source software. In its current implementation version (*December 2022*), it combines Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data products. 
Level 1 and Level 2 input Landsat 8 (LS8) products are processed to be harmonized with Sentinel-2 data (S2).
The two following ARD product types are generated: 
* Harmonized Surface Reflectance Products (Level 2H) - at 30m of resolution,
* Fused Surface Reflectance Products (Level 2F) - at 10-20m of resolution. 

This __harmonisation__ process increases the theoretical number of acquisitions of this virtual constellation (95 
 products/year) by 30 % with respect to Sentinel-2 (S2A & S2B) only acquisitions (73 products/year) and promotes 
 the pixel-based analysis with the extraction of fit-for-purpose dense __time series__, essential 
 for bio-geophysical variables monitoring for instance.

Regardless Missions, Product Type, __Gridded__ data are delivered, the S2 tiling system is based on
the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS).

Since __Sen2Like 4.3.0__, in addition to Sentinel-2 and Landsat missions, there have been an effort to integrate the PRISMA Earth Observation mission, which is a medium-resolution hyperspectral imaging satellite, developed, owned and operated by ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana).  
Sen2like software supports the PRISMA L1 products through the usage of a pre-processor named "prisma4sen2like" that transforms PRISMA L1 products into an internal format: Sentinel-2 PRISMA (S2P) L1C products, spectrally aggregated into 13 Sentinel-2 bands and projected into L1C Sentinel-2 geometry (without refinement on Sentinel-2 GRI).

The __processing workflow__ is based on following algorithms:
*	Geometric Corrections including registration to common reference & the stitching [4],
*	Atmospheric Corrections by using SMAC [5] relying on auxiliary meteorological data,
*	Application of Spectral Band Adjustment Factor (SBAF) [2],
*	Transformation to Nadir BRDF-normalized Reflectance (NBAR) [6],[7],
*	Production of LS8 High Resolution 10 m pixel spacing data (Fusion) [8].
 
Beside these features, the user specifies the geographic footprint of multi temporal data stack.
It is therefore possible, to cover large geographic extent with a __seamless image mosaic__.  

It is worth noting that the overall accuracy of your final ARD product strongly depends on the accuracy of sen2like auxiliary data. Two categories of auxiliary data are important: the raster reference for geometric corrections and the meteorological data for atmospheric corrections. Regarding atmospheric corrections, one possibility is to use data from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service [9]. The Sen2Like team prepared a dedicated CAMS monthly dataset for the Year 2020, available from [here](http://185.178.85.51/CAMS/). Please refer to this short [description](http://185.178.85.51/CAMS/Readme_CAMS2020.txt) for additional information.
